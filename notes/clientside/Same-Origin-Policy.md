## **🔹 What Is the Same-Origin Policy (SOP)?**

The **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)** is a security feature implemented by web browsers that **restricts how scripts from one origin can interact with resources from another origin**.

✅ **By default, a web page can only access data from the same origin it was loaded from.**
❌ **It cannot read data (cookies, responses, storage) from another origin.**
---

## **🔹 What Is an "Origin"?**

An **origin** consists of:

- **Protocol** (HTTP/HTTPS)
- **Host** (Domain)
- **Port** (Optional)

Two URLs have the **same origin** if **all three** match.

| URL                       | Origin                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `https://example.com:443` | `https://example.com:443` |
| `https://api.example.com` | `https://api.example.com` |
| `http://example.com`      | `http://example.com`      |
| `http://example.com:3000` | `http://example.com:3000` |

🚨 **Different Origins Example** (These are considered different origins):

1.  `https://example.com` **≠** `http://example.com` (different **protocol**)
2.  `https://example.com` **≠** `https://api.example.com` (different **subdomain**)
3.  `https://example.com` **≠** `https://example.com:3000` (different **port**)

## **🔹 How Does SOP Prevent CSRF?**

Let's assume:

- Your **frontend** (`FE`) runs on `https://frontend.com`.
- Your **backend** (`BE`) runs on `https://api.example.com`.

Now, a **malicious website** (`hacker.com`) tries to attack.

### **🚨 What the Attacker Wants to Do**

1.  The victim **logs into `example.com`**, and their browser **stores an HTTP-only authentication cookie**.
2.  The victim then **visits `hacker.com`**, which contains malicious JavaScript.
3.  That script tries to make a request to `https://api.example.com` using `fetch()`.

js

CopyEdit

`fetch("https://api.example.com/delete-account", { method: "POST" });`

### **🛡️ How SOP Blocks This**

✅ **`hacker.com` CANNOT read cookies from `api.example.com`**.
✅ The `fetch()` request **sends the cookie**, but without a valid CSRF token in the header, the server **rejects the request**.
✅ Even if the attacker **injects malicious code into the frontend**, they **cannot steal the CSRF token** (because it's stored in an HTTP-only cookie).

---

## **🔹 But Wait! My Frontend and Backend Have Different Origins!**

Yes, they do.
By default, **your frontend (`frontend.com`) cannot access your backend (`api.example.com`)** due to SOP.
👉 **To allow this, you must enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).**

### **🚀 How to Fix This?**

Your backend **must explicitly allow requests from your frontend.**
Example **CORS configuration in Express.js**:

js

CopyEdit

`import cors from "cors";  app.use(   cors({     origin: "https://frontend.com", // Allow requests from FE     credentials: true, // Allow cookies     methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"], // Allowed methods     allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "X-XSRF-TOKEN"], // Custom headers   }) );`

✅ Now, **only `https://frontend.com`** can make requests to `api.example.com`.
✅ **Cookies are included only for allowed origins**.
✅ **Other origins (like `hacker.com`) are blocked!**

## **📌 Final Takeaways**

| Attack Attempt                         | Can It Steal Cookies?  | Can It Make Requests?    | Will CSRF Protection Work? |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **User visits `frontend.com`**         | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes (Allowed by CORS) | ✅ CSRF Protection Works   |
| **Malicious script from `hacker.com`** | ❌ No (Blocked by SOP) | ❌ No (Blocked by CORS)  | ✅ CSRF Protection Works   |

💡 **SOP protects against data leaks.**
💡 **CORS ensures only the frontend can access the backend.**
💡 **CSRF tokens prevent unauthorized requests.**

🚀 **Final Answer:** **The malicious website (`hacker.com`) cannot read cookies from `example.com` because of the Same-Origin Policy, and it cannot send CSRF tokens because it lacks access to them.**
