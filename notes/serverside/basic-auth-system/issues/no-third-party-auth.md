## **ðŸ”¹ Problem: No Third-Party Authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)**

### **ðŸ›‘ Issue:**

Right now, users **must create an account** in your system with **email and password.**

- What if they **want to log in using Google or Facebook?**
- You'd have to **manually integrate** each third-party login system.

ðŸ“Œ **Scenario:**

- A user **doesn't want to create a new account** in your system.
- They already have a **Google or Facebook account.**
- They **want to use it to log in.**
- Your system **does not support** third-party logins.
- The user **abandons your app** and goes to a competitor.

ðŸ“Œ **How OAuth2 + OpenID Connect Helps?**

- With OAuth2 + OIDC, users can log in with **Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc.**
- Your system **never sees their password.**
- The user **clicks 'Login with Google'** â†’ Google authenticates â†’ **Your app gets an access token**.
